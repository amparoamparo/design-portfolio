Illustrated poster featuring hand lettering. This piece is part of an on-going personal project consisting of gig poster designs for shows I recently went to. Made in a faux risograph style using Procreate and Photoshop.

After sharing the poster on social media, the band said: _'This is so cute!!!'_.
