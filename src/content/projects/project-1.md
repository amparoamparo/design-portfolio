ASH Guitars is Argentina's leading guitar and bass repair business, trusted by iconic musicians such as Gustavo Cerati, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Guillermo Vadal√°, and Walter Giardino, to name a few. Established in 1980, ASH Guitars is the first certified Fender repair centre in Latin America, and also an official D'Addario partner.

I refreshed their visual identity by modernising the original 1980s logo while preserving signature elements such as the six dots beside the "A", which symbolise a guitar headstock.

Additionally, I designed badge-style graphics for merch, and designed and developed a responsive one-page website that has increased their service inquiries and gained them a notable number of new clients.
